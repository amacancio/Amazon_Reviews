### Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether there was any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in the chosen dataset.

### Results
Before being split into Vine and non-Vine, the data was filtered to show only reviews that received more than 20 total votes, as well as having a percentage of helpful votes equal than or greater to 50%.

Total number of reviews within the parameters: 65,149
Total number of Vine reviews: 0
Total number of 5-star Vine Reviews: 0
Percentage of 5-star Vine Reviews: 0%
Total number of non-Vine reviews: 65,149
Total number of 5-star non-Vine Reviews: 24,673
Percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews: 37.87%

### Summary
There does not seem to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program for the chosen dataset, which was Amazon Ebooks. As a matter of fact, there were no Vine reviews which fit the parameters of 20 or more helpful votes and percentage of helpful votes. This goes to show that, at least in the Ebooks category, there is no Vine bias in the most popular reviews; however, when looking at the data without the inital parameters, there are a total of 27 Vine reviews, so it would be interesting to examine the reviews and see the distribution of total votes as well as helpful votes to examine the validity of the excluded reviews.
